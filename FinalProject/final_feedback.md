# Feedback on Final

Good work on the final project overall.  A few notes:
1. The project asked that you use functions. You have some function definitions, but they don't add any value -- either encapsulating complex code or abstracting duplication of logic.  A function `dropna()` that simply calls `df.dropna()` for example, doesn't provide any value to the project.  
2. Remember that variable names should mean something.  Names like `pivot_table_1` don't provide any insight into what that variable is for.
3. You could have provided more documentation and explanation along the way.  Why are you taking the next steps and what do you hope to show.
